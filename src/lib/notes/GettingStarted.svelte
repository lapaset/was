<p>
	Hello and welcome to my <em>Web Accessibility Specialist</em> study diary!
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of this document is to help me keep track of my progress and serve
	as a reminder if I need to take a break at some point.
</p>

<p>
	The page is public because I hope others could benefit from it too. This is of
	course inspired by <a href="https://100daysofa11y.com/"> 100 Days of A11y</a> â€”
	the classic that has helped me and so many others in our accessibility studies.
</p>

<p>
	This page is built with <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> so it would be
	as light as possible. The main content is notes, but I plan also to take the studies
	into practice and create accessible components while on it.
</p>

<h3>My background</h3>

<p>
	I have started my career as a web developer 2019 and accessibility has been my
	main interest from the beginning. Since March 2023 I'm a Certified
	Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (<a
		href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional"
		>CPACC</a
	>).
</p>

<p>Let's get this journey started!</p>
